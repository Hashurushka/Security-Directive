Security Directive


Data Security)  Karl has consulted with ex military friends who went into intelligence on how best to secure his data. He uses a few inexpensive but effective ways to protect his data based on this information. Due to his murderous inclinations, his status as a decorated veteran and his dubious dealings with members of the ex-Wazi party as well as the secret heritage info he knows he is quite paranoid about data privacy and this has resulted in a very paranoid system.


> [!NOTE] Time Of Tech
> I have done my best to ensure that all of these technological options were around before/during 2016.



On the physical side Karl has physically removed all the webcams and microphones from his laptops and so forth. If needed for calls from home he has separate usb webcams and mics that are only plugged in as are needed. 

If needing to talk to anyone depending on the other person he has a few different options

For interacting with the general MPs and also whomever in the Government he needs to on official business he will use Whatsapp as that is the messenger of choice. He does not back these up on the cloud but to make sure he does not lose any important potential blackmail info he backs them up to a not too large USB stick and buries it in his back garden once every few months.

He does not use any cloud services for storage in general.

For messages below that tier, slightly more nefarious but not too damning messages he uses Signal. 

Anything in the realm of plotting, illegality, or uploading data to the public anonymously he either uses the Tor network on a Tails USB Stick
https://tails.net/
Tails is a free Operating System that runs off a USB stick and never touches the Hard Drive which means that it leaves no trace on the computer. In fact because of this he is able to bring his Tails USB stick wherever he goes so no matter what he always has the ability to make contact with whoever he wishes to. The only data that is stored on the USB stick is what the user wants to and even that is heavily encrypted. Any of his regular contacts he also tells to use TAILS with a USB stick. 

Any messages that he sends to people are also heavily encrypted. He makes use of [PGP encryption](https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/pgp-encryption#:~:text=PGP%20is%20extremely%20safe%2C%20if,protect%20data%20and%20cloud%20systems.) (Pretty Good Privacy). This system follows the following 3 steps:

1. Step 1: PGP generates a huge, one-time-use public encryption algorithm that cannot be guessed, which becomes the random session key.
2. Step 2: The session key is then encrypted using the recipient’s public key, which protects the message while being transmitted. The recipient shares that key with anyone they want to receive messages from.
3. Step 3: The message sender submits their session key, then the recipient can decrypt the message using their private key.

This system, also making use of Digital Signatures allows to see if any messages have been tampered with, even if only a single character was amended. 
    As experts say: "The biggest advantage of PGP encryption is that the algorithm is unbreakable. It is widely used by people who need to secure their private communications and is considered a leading method for enhancing cloud security. That is because PGP makes it impossible for a hacker, nation-states, or government agencies to break into files or emails protected by PGP encryption...
    
    PGP is extremely safe, if used correctly and securely by individuals and organizations’ employees. The encryption method uses algorithms that are considered unbreakable and is one of the most secure ways to protect data and cloud systems. Protecting data with PGP makes it effectively impossible to be intercepted by hackers.

If for some reason a website he needs to access blocks the Tor network entirely, he relies on a backup VPN with Mullvad. They offer multi-hop for improved anonymisation but most importantly their service relies on Diskless Servers which through failed police raids have been proven to not hold any data.
    For extra security he uses Mullvad's privacy payment feature of sending an anonymous payment by sending a letter to them with €60 for a year in it and his account no. 
    This is dropped off somewhere once a year somewhere randomly somewhere in the country away from his home in a letterbox. Mullvad do not have his name or email or any details on record for him.
For anonymous emails he uses either the pre-installed Thunderbird email on TailsOS or ProtonMail. For some transfer of larger media files he also uses OnionShare. 

He ensures to use Metadata Cleaner preinstalled on TailsOS when sending files to make sure no identifying metadata is on the file. 

If Karl does end up saving something important there he makes sure to offload it as soon as possible through a raspberry pi that he installed behind a light switch in his attic. He simply pulls off the switch with some pliers and behind is a usb port that he plugs the tails OS into to offload any valuable information. It is not connected to any network.

As he cannot apply this level of standard for every single employee at his MP office/in his Defence secretary for the average person he requires the following for his employees.

 - All laptop cameras must have a plastic slide on covered at all times of non use
 - All laptop mics must be covered with tape when not in use.
 - Department requires that issued government phones are iPhones to reduce risk of hacks.
 - All Employees must use 2FA to login to anything to protect from phishing attempts.
 - All employees must study a brief hack prevention course before starting and pass an accompanying test. This can be retaken a few times before passing. Not too difficult. Also warns against irl hacking attempts e.g Dropped USB Sticks or even cables that hide hidden computers inside.
 - Korgen will occasionally send out phishing emails and other tests to see if his employees are staying on top of it.
 - All departmental laptops and phones have preinstalled VPN's to ensure no security leaks on public wifi.

On him at all times he carries with him. All of them are pre setup and need almost no technical knowledge to use apart from being able to stick a usb stick into something.

 - Aforementioned TailsOS USB
 - A USB Killer
 - Proxmark3 (RFID Sniffer and Cloner)
 - Keylogger  (physical stick that can track )
 - and a few...
 - [Rubber Duckies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ygrauer/2016/09/02/mr-robot-season-2-episode-9-rubber-duckie-youre-the-one/) (USB Stick that looks like a normal USB stick but disguises itself as a keyboard to the operating system and therefore bypasses almost all security checks) This can do a few things 
     - 1) - Go to a certain website and download malware or ransomware.
     - Pull up a website with code that puts a “backdoor” into your system, giving hackers the entrance they need to manipulate accounts or commit other types of [fraud](http://www.sqnbankingsystems.com/resources/articles-faq/bank-fraud-from-a-z/).
     - Launch an app or a reverse-shell program, allowing the hacker to track the keystrokes you enter so they can steal usernames, passwords, and other critical details.
     - Delete, add, or steal files.
     - Change server settings to route websites to identical yet malicious site that steals their information e.g a fake bank account website.

This always puts him at an advantage. With the USB killer if he for some reason is on a computer or phone etc with sensitive information and feels like he is at risk of that item being taken all he needs to do is plug it in and it will kill the device. If ever found with these devices he can say that he uses them for legitimate testing on the security of his own office.

The other items are more offensive and allow him at opportune moments to gain information. This will come into play during the crisis likely, but in many ways the best defense is a good offense and if Karl can gain info on people it may make them less likely to get involved with him. 




Physical Protection Security Directive

Firstly, Karl is huge and well trained. He rarely need physical security, yet when he does for a certain event he not only has the security that is provided to him in accordance with his station at any current time (Defense Secretary as of writing) but also can make use of some of his old military buddies. They can do sweeps of areas beforehand, accompany him as physical protection at high risk events, and just generally provide a deterrence through their presence. 

Karl however down the lines intends to form a private militia. He has discussed these plans confidentially over PGP messages to close ex military friends. If Karl is successful in his plans to start a government trained militia movement he intends to have many of his former friends in positions of power in the organisation. Even without his interference as these are veterans as well they should be able to command roles as HomeGuard Officers, especially involved in the training process. These alllies would be there to look out for members that are the most patriotic, devout and ready to do what it takes and separate them.  
    If this plan comes to fruition, and down the line any crazy things happen down the line this group will hopefully act as Korgen's private militia. 

Karl also owns a firearms license and several legally owned and stored rifles. He has first aid kits in his home, and a Go Bag with MREs and other important items in case he ever needs to make a quick exit.
