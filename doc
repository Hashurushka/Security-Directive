Data Security: Karl's Approach
Karl, a decorated veteran with a complex background involving dubious dealings and a deep concern for data privacy, has developed a highly secure system for protecting his data. This system, informed by consultations with ex-military friends now in intelligence, employs various inexpensive yet effective methods.

Note on Technology
[!NOTE] Time Of Tech: Efforts have been made to ensure all technological options mentioned were available before or during 2016.

Physical Security Measures
Karl has taken significant steps to secure his devices physically:

Webcams and Microphones: All webcams and microphones have been removed from his devices. Separate USB webcams and mics are used and only connected when necessary.
Secure Communication: For official government interactions, WhatsApp is used without cloud backups. Sensitive information is stored on a USB stick and securely hidden. Signal is used for less sensitive communications, while the Tor network and Tails OS on a USB stick are reserved for highly confidential or illegal activities.
Encryption and Anonymity
PGP Encryption: Karl employs PGP encryption for message security, ensuring that communications are secure and tamper-evident.
Tails OS: A free operating system that runs off a USB stick, leaving no trace on the computer. It's used for secure and anonymous internet access.
VPN and Anonymity Services: For sites blocking Tor, Karl uses Mullvad VPN, known for its diskless servers and privacy-focused payment options.
Anonymous Email and File Sharing: Karl uses Thunderbird on TailsOS and ProtonMail for email, and OnionShare for file transfers, ensuring that no metadata compromises his anonymity.
Office Security Protocols
Karl has implemented strict security measures for his staff, including physical covers for laptop cameras and mics, the use of iPhones to reduce hack risks, mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA), and cybersecurity training. Additionally, he conducts regular security tests to ensure vigilance.

Personal Security Devices
Karl carries several devices for security and information gathering, including:

TailsOS USB: For secure and anonymous internet access.
USB Killer: To destroy devices holding sensitive information if compromised.
Proxmark3: An RFID sniffer and cloner.
Keylogger: A device to track keystrokes.
Rubber Duckies: USB devices that mimic keyboards to bypass security and perform various malicious tasks.
Physical Protection Security Directive
Despite being well-trained and physically imposing, Karl has plans for enhanced physical security, including the formation of a private militia with ex-military friends. He is also prepared for emergencies with a firearms license, first aid kits, and a "Go Bag" with essential survival items.
